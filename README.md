# Directory Rule. 
not obligation, but recommendation. 


## Prefixe Meanings. 

prefixes in directories have meanings.
	prj : project
	dt  : data
	src : source codes
	fig : figures
	ref : references that will be needed or shared
	res : summary of research. That will include MS word or MS powerpoint files.
	old : Containing files that will not be used. Saved for review.
* a directory without a prefix is an exception.

usually, prj_[name]/src/*.ipynb is important.
